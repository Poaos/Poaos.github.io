<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm pursuing a master's degree in automation at Northwestern Polytechnical University ([西北工业大学自动化学院](https://zdhxy.nwpu.edu.cn/)). I earned my bachelor’s degree at School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology ([河北工业大学机械工程学院](https://mes.hebut.edu.cn/)). 

My research interest includes robotic exploration, especially multi-rotor UAV platforms.

Abstract: LAEA utilizes 2D LiDAR to quickly acquire contour information from the environment and generates a hybrid map that characterizes the exploration value of the surrounding environment using multi-sensor data. Based on the hybrid map, small and isolated frontier clusters that can lead to repeated movements are quickly detected, and their access in prioritized.
