Abstract: LAEA utilizes 2D LiDAR to quickly acquire contour information from the environment and generates a hybrid map that characterizes the exploration value of the surrounding environment using multi-sensor data. Based on the hybrid map, small and isolated frontier clusters that can lead to repeated movements are quickly detected, and their access in prioritized.
